syntax:
-------
	<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
		-
		- //set of statements 
		-
	</script>

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
			document.write("Welcome to JavaScript");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

Note:
-----
	Here "type" and "language" attribute is optional to declare.
	semicolon is not mandatory because javascript is a loosely typed checking language.

ex:
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script >
			document.write("Welcome to JavaScript World")
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script >
			document.write("Welcome to QualityThought");
			document.write('This is JavaScript class');
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script >
			document.writeln("Welcome to QualityThought");
			document.writeln('This is JavaScript class');
		</script>
</body>
</html>
Note:
-----
	Here document.writeln() will give the space at the end of the statement.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script >
			document.writeln("Welcome to QualityThought");
			<br>
			document.writeln('This is JavaScript class');
		</script>
</body>
</html>

Note:
-----
	Above program is invalid because we can't declare markup language inside scripting language.

ex:
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script >
			document.writeln("Welcome to QualityThought");
			document.writeln("<br>");
			document.writeln('This is JavaScript class');
		</script>
</body>
</html>

In javascript we can declare HTML and CSS code also.

ex:
---
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script >
			document.writeln("<h1>Welcome to QualityThought</h1>");
			document.writeln("<br>");
	document.writeln("<p style='text-align:center'>This is JavaScript class</p>");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

Note:
-----
	If a document contains HTML code, CSS code and JavaScript then it is called DHTML.
	DHTML stands for Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language.

JavaScript Engine 
=================
It is used to execute javascript code in a browser window.

It is used to convert user understable scripting language to machine understandable scripting language.

Every browser contains javascript engine.

We have following list of javascript engines.

ex:
	Browser 		JavaScript Engine 
	------			----------------
	Chrome 			V8 Engine 
	Mozilla			Spider Monkey 
	Edge			Chakra 
	and etc.


Comments in JavaScript 
========================
Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

JavaScript engine will not display comments in browser window.

We have two types of comments in javascript.

1) Single Line comment 
---------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 

2) Multiple Line comment 
---------------------
	It is more convenient because we can comment a single line as well as multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/

Note:
-----

HTML
----
	<!-- comment here --> 

CSS
----
	/*
		comment here 
	*/

ex:
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<!-- javascript code -->
		<script >
			// custom output 1
			document.writeln("Hello World <br>");

			/* custom output 2 */
			document.writeln("Thank you");
		</script>
</body>
</html>
